Coming from Kent apart from the odd band/gig it does seem to be (London aside) midlands/north that most gigs, festivals etc are. Do bands class London as the entire south?*

The question came about, would they still have become the absolute giants that they are today if Mustaine was still in the band. Or if Cliff Burton hadn't passed, would the Black album have been a thing? I reckon that they'd still be the massive band they are.*

And how can we stop it?*

People that seemed like they had no real interest in rock music and didn’t seem to properly grasp things like ‘moshing etiquette’. Frank Carter has no doubt had some mainstream attention this year which may have pulled these people in and while it wasn’t too big an issue it just got me thinking... If ‘our’ bands got as big as we would love them to and got the mainstream attention they deserve, could it have a negative effect? One of the things me (and I daresay so many others) love about heavy music is that it feels exclusive. I love walking into a room and seeing a hundred different band t-shirts of bands that I love. Could we be in danger of losing that magic if the bands get truly huge?*

Is there any other band you would love to make a great record that hasn't had one in a while.*
- **[Sean Willis](https://www.facebook.com/thatsnotmetalpodcast/posts/2218282215064977?comment_id=2218444911715374&comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R9%22%7D)**: *Would you ever do an albums of the year list with albums outside of rock and metal? I thought Run The Jewels might sneak into Beez’s list this year 😝*
